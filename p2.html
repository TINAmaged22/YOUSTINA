<blockquote><h1>Instructions</h1></blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
<li>Slice the eggplant into 2cm thick pieces.</li>
<li>On a baking tray, put a generous glug of olive oil. Take a slice of eggplant and dip it in the oil, then turning over and dipping again until well covered. Place on the baking tray and repeat for all eggplant slices. Use more olive oil if needed. Bake in the oven until brown.</li>
<li>On another baking tray, place the lamb chops. Season with salt and pepper. Bake in the oven until brown.</li>
<li>In a bowl, add the rice, seven spices, salt and pepper. Mix together.</li>
<li>Grab a deep pot and cut out a circular piece of parchment paper to fit the bottom. Spray the bottom of the bottom with oil and place in your parchment paper.</li>
<li>Add in your cooked lamb chops, followed by your cooked eggplant slices and then pour over your uncooked rice mixture.</li>
<li>Add 5 cups of hot water.</li>
<li>Bring to a boil, half cover with the lid and reduce to a simmer. Let cook for 20 minutes or until all the water has evaporated. Remove the lid.</li>
<li>Find a large flat plate and place it on top of the pot. Holding onto the plate and pot handles, quickly lift and flip upside down. </li>
<li>Lift the pot up to reveal your Maklouba and remove the parchment paper.</li>
<li>Sprinkle pine nuts over and enjoy!</li>
